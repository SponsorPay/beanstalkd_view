Beanstalkd View
===============
A Sinatra app to view/manage beanstalkd queues that can be embedded in a Rails app similar to what's available in Resque.

Configuration
-------------

To use in a Rails app, include the gem in your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'beanstalk-client', :git => 'https://github.com/kr/beanstalk-client-ruby.git' #Use the latest, if you need the pause-tube command
gem beanstalkd_view
```

Otherwise, gem install beanstalkd_view


Use the following environment variable to specify the location of the beanstalk server:

``` ruby
ENV['BEANSTALK_URL'] = 'beanstalk://localhost/'
```

(This can be a comma separated list.)

Embedding in a Rails app
------------------------

Add the following to your routes.rb file:

``` ruby
mount BeanstalkdView::Server, :at => "/beanstalkd"
```

(NOTE: You may mount the server at any path, not just /beanstalkd)

You can then browse to your application path to view information about your beanstalkd tubes, i.e.
http://127.0.0.1:3000/beanstalkd

If you wish to authenticate the mounted app with Devise, it would look something like:

``` ruby
devise_for :admin_users, ActiveAdmin::Devise.config

match('/beanstalkd/admin/login' => redirect('/admin/login'))
authenticate :admin_user do
  mount BeanstalkdView::Server, at: "/beanstalkd"
end
```

Running from the command line
------------------------

Use rackup, shotgun or whatever.
